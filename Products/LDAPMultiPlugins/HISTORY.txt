HISTORICAL CHANGES
==================

1.9 (2010-01-27)
----------------

- Feature: The enumerateUsers method has a parameter "exact_match" that 
  was only applied if the search was by logn or user id, since that is
  the way it is used in the standard PluggableAuthService plugins. 
  However, the user folder searchUsers method can accept this parameter
  as well and thus limit searches by other criteria to exact matches.
  This is useful enough to implement, even though it breaks the standard.

1.8 (2009-02-17)
----------------

- Bug: Move plugin registration from initialize method to module level to
  avoid multiple registrations.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00631 by Ramon Navarro Bosch)

- Feature: Implemented GenericSetup import/export handlers and registered
  import/export steps.

- Bug: Fixed the Zope dependency, which was listed as 2.8+. It's 2.9+.


1.7 (2008-07-19)
----------------

- Bug: LDAPMultiPlugin.enumerateUsers: The variable used as key for the
  caching mechanism was mutated after being computed, leading to cache
  keys that can never be found again. Found by Wichert Akkerman.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00613)


1.6 (2008-06-05)
----------------

- Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: In order to support
  group searches on the binary objectGUID attribute, utilize a new
  flag exposed by the LDAPUserFolder LDAPDelegate search method
  that prevents the customary UTF8-encoding of the search filter
  expression. **NOTE**: With this change the LDAPUserFolder version
  dependency changes to version 2.9 or higher!
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00576 by Wichert Akkerman)

- Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: If the requested group
  id is a binary string, like a objectGUID attribute, it was mangled
  by a lowercasing operation. Removed the lowercasing.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00575 by Wichert Akkerman)

- Feature: Added caching to the getGroupsForPrincipal method. Thanks to 
  Wichert Akkerman for the patch.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00571)


1.5 (2007-06-13)
----------------

- Bug: The product will no longer silently fail to install if the 
  LDAPUserFolder package is not installed. Silent failure does
  not look like a good strategy here.

- Bug: fixes and import cleanups after running Pyflakes
  (http://divmod.org:81/svn/Divmod/trunk/Pyflakes/)

- Documentation: added some additional configuration hints to the README, 
  thanks go to Brett Lentz (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00559)


1.5-beta (2007-03-03)
---------------------

- LDAPMultiPlugin.enumerateUsers: If no useful search criteria are
  given (meaning no user ID or login is specified), fabricate a
  criteria set that will return all users, this is the expected
  behavior when calling enumerateUsers.

- LDAPMultiPlugin.enumerateUsers: When iterating over search results
  from the user folder we now look for the special "fake result"
  emitted by the user folder if there is an error. Not elegant, but
  needed until error handling is changed in the LDAPUserFolder.

- Instead of throwing exceptions, the ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin
  will now log error conditions and continue, with a patch from
  Mark Hammond.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00554)

- Adjusted an import that has been removed from the
  PluggableAuthService utils module.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00542)

- Remove the ICredentialsUpdatePlugin implementation - it was
  implemented wrongly and should not have been part of the contract
  at all due to an interface misunderstanding.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00539)

- Moved the PluggableAuthService dependency up to version 1.4


1.4 (2006-10-16)
----------------

- The ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin did not ensure to correctly
  escape search filters it constructed internally.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00507)

- The add form selection whether or not to use SSL for the LDAP
  server connection was not handed through correctly, identified
  by Olivier Nicole (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00526)

- Revamped the way recursive group memberships are found and applied,
  not sure if the previous implementation was a bug or not. Many thanks
  to John Hannon for a patch. This change includes the ability to 
  specify a nesting depth to which the recursive search will go.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00513)

- Added some notes on how to enable caching using the ZCacheable
  mechanism


1.3 (2006-07-29)
----------------

- Update the enumerateGroups method to use the new LDAPUserFolder
  method "searchGroups". This changes the LDAPUserFolder dependency
  to version 2.7. Patch provided by Leonardo Rochael Almeida.

- The ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin enumerateUsers method would only
  search correctly if login or id were explicitly specified 
  (thanks to Sidnei da Silva for the patch).

- Make sure to apply the same checks for user existence in
  getRolesForPrincipal that are used by getPropertiesForUser
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00503 by Riccardo Lemmi)

- Fixed the enumerateUsers implementation to be more efficient and
  use the new searchUsers method on the LDAPUserFolder (thanks to
  Wichert Akkerman for the problem description and solution)

- Added simple caching of groups information, provided by 
  Leonardo Rochael Almeida.

- Software dependencies are now documented in a separate 
  DEPENDENCIES.txt file. Please note that the packages mentioned
  in DEPENDENCIES.txt may have their own dependencies that must be
  satisfied as well.

- Replaced all zLOG usage with equivalent calls into the Python
  logging module, and reducing the chattiness coded into the
  ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin (INFO -> DEBUG)

- Started on a test suite


1.2 (2006-03-02)
----------------

- In order to avoid duplicate search results, the enumerateUsers
  method used a simple dictionary to store DNs for records that
  were already processed. However, the keys put into this dictionary
  were munged and really could not be compared to raw search
  result DNs anymore. Thanks go to Wichert Akkerman for spotting this
  obvious error (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00485).

- Speed up enumerateGroups by letting the LDAP server do more of
  the filtering (thanks to Wichert Akkerman,
  http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00483)

- Applied a performance fix to the ActiveDirectoryPlugin's
  _recurseGroups method (thanks got to Mark Hammond for the patch,
  http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00476)


1.1 (2005-10-29)
----------------

- The LDAPMultiPlugins ignored default roles configured on the
  LDAPUserFolder and would not add it to the set of roles
  computed (seen by Sidnei da Silva).

- enumerateUsers now allows you to do exact-match searches on 
  attributes other than just the user ID and login (patch
  by Sidnei da Silva). **Note**: This code now requires
  LDAPUserFolder versions 2.6 or higher, which support exact 
  match searches using LDAPUserFolder.findUsers.


1.0 (2005-08-18)
----------------

- The interface machinery expected by the PluggableAuthService has
  been changed to use Zope 3-style interfaces. Thanks go to Leonardo 
  Rochael Almeida who provided a patch to fix the resulting breakage.

- Changed the initialization code for the plugins to conform to the
  changed initialization code in the LDAPUserFolder product versions
  2.6beta3 and up.


1.0beta3
--------

- Changes to the way the user IDs are mangled/unmangled to be in line
  with the changes in the latest PluggableAuthService code
  (Patch provided by Mark Hammond)


1.0beta2
--------

- When retrieving properties for a user, None values have to be
  converted to an empty string to prevent the user propertysheet
  machinery from blowing up trying to guess what kind of 
  property a None value could represent.


1.0beta1
--------

- Role retrieval was broken, small fix involves changing a call to the
  LDAPUserFolder


LDAPMultiPlugins 0.9
--------------------

- First public release
