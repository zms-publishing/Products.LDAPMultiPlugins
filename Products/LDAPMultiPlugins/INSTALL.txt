Installing the LDAPMultiPlugins Product

    It is assumed that you have installed the PluggableAuthService and
    PluginRegistry products already. They are available from cvs.zope.org.

    This product does not require any special handling after unzipping
    and untarring it in the Zope Products directory. You should do 
    something like::

        $ cp LDAPMultiPlugins-xyz.tgz <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ cd <zope_root>/lib/python/Products
        $ tar zxvf LDAPMultiPlugins-xyz.tgz
        <watch files being decompressed>

    Windows users can use WinZip or similar, it can handle tarred 
    gzip files. Make sure to move the extracted LDAPMultiPlugins 
    folder to your Zope installation's lib/python/Products-folder.

    That's all. Do not forget to restart Zope afterwards. You will then
    be able to select the "LDAP Multi Plugin" and the "Active Directory
    Multi Plugin" from the list of plugins to add when you navigate to
    your PluggableAuthService-based user folder and select the "Contents" 
    tab in the Zope Management Interface (ZMI).

    See README.txt for any other dependencies and requirements.
