 Products.LDAPMultiPlugins
===========================

.. contents::

The LDAPMultiPlugins provides PluggableAuthService plugins that use LDAP as 
the backend for the services they provide. The PluggableAuthService is a 
Zope user folder product that can be extended in modular fashion using 
various plugins.

Customizations:
===============

This fork contains the following customizations:

Lookup groups base DN
---------------------

The optional property `lookup_groups_base` allows to use different base DNs for group lookups than for group enumeration.
If the plugin_property `lookup_groups_base` is defined, the plugin will use the DN defined in `lookup_groups_base` for group lookups (`getGroupsForPrincipal`), but the group enumeration ('enumerateGroups`) still uses the DN defined in the property `groups_base`.

Special features - Active Directory Multi Plugin
================================================

Properties of the ADMultiPlugin instance:

- groupid_attr - the LDAP attribute used for group ids.

- grouptitle_attr - the LDAP attribute used to compose group titles.

- group_class - the LDAP class of group objects.

- group_recurse - boolean indicating whether to determine group
  memberships of a user by unrolling nested group relationships
  (expensive). This feature is not guaranteed to work at this moment.


Active Directory configuration hints
====================================

In order for groups support to work correctly, you may have to set the
following properties. Every situation is different, but this has helped
some people succeed:

- On the "Properties" tab for the ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin, set the
  groupid_attr property to "name".

- On the contained LDAPUserFolder's "Configure" tab, choose a 
  property other than "objectGUID", e.g. "sAMAccountName" for the
  User ID property. To get to the LDAPUserFolder, click on the
  ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin "Content" tab.

Please see README.ActiveDirectory from the LDAPUserFolder package for
additional information.
