README for the Zope LDAPMultiPlugins Product

  The LDAPMultiPlugins provides PluggableAuthService plugins that use 
  LDAP as the backend for the services they provide. The 
  PluggableAuthService is a Zope user folder product that can be extended 
  in modular fashion using various plugins. See DEPENDENCIES.txt for 
  software needed by this package.

  Please make sure to read the documentation included in the 
  LDAPUserFolder package as well.


  **Caching**

    The results of some calls into the plugins provided by these package can
    be cached using the Zope ZCacheable mechanism:

    - In the Zope Management Interface (ZMI) of your PluggableAuthService
      instance, select 'RAM Cache Manager' from the dropdown, give it an ID
      and configure it according to your needs.

    - Click on your LDAP/ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin and use the 'Cache' 
      ZMI tab on the far right to associate the newly created RAM Cache
      Manager object with the plugin.

    Now your plugin will use the RAM Cache Manager object to cache results
    from some of the possibly expensive API calls.


  **Special features - Active Directory Multi Plugin**
  
    * Properties of the ADMultiPlugin instance:
    
      * groupid_attr - the LDAP attribute used for group ids.
    
      * grouptitle_attr - the LDAP attribute used to compose group titles.
    
      * group_class - the LDAP class of group objects.
    
      * group_recurse - boolean indicating whether to determine group
        memberships of a user by unrolling nested group relationships
        (expensive). This feature is not guaranteed to work at this moment.


  **Active Directory configuration hints**

    In order for groups support to work correctly, you may have to set the
    following properties. Every situation is different, but this has helped
    some people succeed:

      * On the "Properties" tab for the ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin, set the
        groupid_attr property to "name".

      * On the contained LDAPUserFolder's "Configure" tab, choose a 
        property other than "objectGUID", e.g. "sAMAccountName" for the
        User ID property. To get to the LDAPUserFolder, click on the
        ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin "Content" tab.

    Please see README.ActiveDirectory from the LDAPUserFolder package for
    additional information.
