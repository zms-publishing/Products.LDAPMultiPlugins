Changelog for Products.LDAPMultiplugins
=======================================

To see earlier changes please see HISTORY.txt.

1.11 (unreleased)
-----------------

- Bug: Added GenericSetup magic to fully provide the INode interface
  for the exporter and importer classes, making it easier to nest 
  within other importers.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/586500)


1.10 (2010-05-27)
-----------------

- Bug: enumerateUsers returned undesired results if an exact match
  was required since LDAP searches are not case sensitive.
  (https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/585901)


1.9 (2010-01-27)
----------------

- Feature: The enumerateUsers method has a parameter "exact_match" that 
  was only applied if the search was by logn or user id, since that is
  the way it is used in the standard PluggableAuthService plugins. 
  However, the user folder searchUsers method can accept this parameter
  as well and thus limit searches by other criteria to exact matches.
  This is useful enough to implement, even though it breaks the standard.

1.8 (2009-02-17)
----------------

- Bug: Move plugin registration from initialize method to module level to
  avoid multiple registrations.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00631 by Ramon Navarro Bosch)

- Feature: Implemented GenericSetup import/export handlers and registered
  import/export steps.

- Bug: Fixed the Zope dependency, which was listed as 2.8+. It's 2.9+.


1.7 (2008-07-19)
----------------

- Bug: LDAPMultiPlugin.enumerateUsers: The variable used as key for the
  caching mechanism was mutated after being computed, leading to cache
  keys that can never be found again. Found by Wichert Akkerman.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00613)


1.6 (2008-06-05)
----------------

- Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: In order to support
  group searches on the binary objectGUID attribute, utilize a new
  flag exposed by the LDAPUserFolder LDAPDelegate search method
  that prevents the customary UTF8-encoding of the search filter
  expression. **NOTE**: With this change the LDAPUserFolder version
  dependency changes to version 2.9 or higher!
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00576 by Wichert Akkerman)

- Bug: ActiveDirectoryMultiPlugin.enumerateGroups: If the requested group
  id is a binary string, like a objectGUID attribute, it was mangled
  by a lowercasing operation. Removed the lowercasing.
  (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00575 by Wichert Akkerman)

- Feature: Added caching to the getGroupsForPrincipal method. Thanks to 
  Wichert Akkerman for the patch.

1.5 (2007-06-13)
----------------

- Bug: The product will no longer silently fail to install if the 
  LDAPUserFolder package is not installed. Silent failure does
  not look like a good strategy here.

- Bug: fixes and import cleanups after running Pyflakes
  (http://divmod.org:81/svn/Divmod/trunk/Pyflakes/)

- Documentation: added some additional configuration hints to the README, 
  thanks go to Brett Lentz (http://www.dataflake.org/tracker/issue_00559)
